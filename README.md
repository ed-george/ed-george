# Ed Holloway-George

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ed, an Android developer, Google Developer Expert and programmer originally from Oxfordshire, UK and now residing in [Nottingham, UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iepNUUxVLJQ).

I have been programming since I was 13 years old and have a broad interest in programming languages, mobile applications and general computer science.

Outside of programming, you can find me playing PokÃ©mon games, supporting Oxford United and looking after my Pomeranian.

You can read more about me and my work on [my website](https://ed-george.github.io/)
