# Ed George

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ed, an Android developer and programmer originally from Oxfordshire, UK.
I have been programming since I was 13 years old and have a broad interest in programming languages, mobile applications and general computer science.

Outside of programming, you can find me playing PokÃ©mon games, supporting Oxford United and enjoying pictures of sausage dogs.

You can read more about me and my work on [my website](https://ed-george.github.io/)
